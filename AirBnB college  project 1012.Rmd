## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}

# Visit frequency of different quarters according to time can be analyzed by plotting trends in 'reviews_per_month' or 'number_of_reviews' over time.

# You can further analyze relationships, trends, and distributions using plots, summary statistics, and aggregations based on these selected columns.
